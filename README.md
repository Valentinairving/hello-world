# hello-world
This is my first assignment for the class intro to PHP.
My name is Valentina and I am 21 years old. I grew up on Vancouver island, and stayed here until last year when I decided to go to university. In May, I returned here after completing 1 year at the University of Toronto. My goal is to complete a bachelors degree in computer science. For right now, I am taking some time off to work and take a couple extra courses. I hope to be able to return to Toronto in January or September. In my spare time I enjoy cooking, reading, and being around animals. I am looking forward to learning more and completing this course :).
